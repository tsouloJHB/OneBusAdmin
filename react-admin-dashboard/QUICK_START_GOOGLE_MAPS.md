# Quick Start: Google Maps Setup

The application now includes a **fallback map** that works without Google Maps, but to get the full interactive map experience, follow these steps:

## üöÄ Option 1: Use Fallback Map (No Setup Required)

The app now automatically shows a fallback map when Google Maps isn't available. This includes:
- ‚úÖ List view of all bus stops with coordinates
- ‚úÖ Route information display
- ‚úÖ Temporary stops management
- ‚úÖ Stop selection and interaction
- ‚úÖ Visual indicators for different stop types

**No additional setup needed!** The fallback map is fully functional for development and testing.

## üó∫Ô∏è Option 2: Enable Full Google Maps (Recommended for Production)

### Step 1: Get a Google Maps API Key

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable these APIs:
   - **Maps JavaScript API** (required)
   - **Places API** (optional, for future features)
4. Go to **Credentials** ‚Üí **Create Credentials** ‚Üí **API Key**
5. Copy your new API key

### Step 2: Configure API Key

Replace the placeholder in `.env`:

```env
# Before (placeholder)
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE

# After (your real key)
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyC1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

### Step 3: Secure Your API Key (Important!)

1. In Google Cloud Console, click on your API key
2. Under **Application restrictions**:
   - Select "HTTP referrers (web sites)"
   - Add: `localhost:3000/*` (for development)
   - Add your production domain when deploying
3. Under **API restrictions**:
   - Select "Restrict key"
   - Choose "Maps JavaScript API"

### Step 4: Enable Billing

Google Maps requires a billing account, but includes:
- üí∞ **$200 free credit per month**
- üÜì **28,500 map loads per month for free**
- üìä **Pay-as-you-go pricing** beyond free tier

### Step 5: Test

1. Restart your development server: `npm start`
2. Navigate to Routes ‚Üí Click map icon on any route
3. You should see the interactive Google Map!

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Google Maps API key not configured"
- Check that your `.env` file has the correct API key
- Restart your development server after changing `.env`

### "Failed to load Google Maps API"
- Verify your API key is valid in Google Cloud Console
- Check that Maps JavaScript API is enabled
- Ensure billing is set up on your Google Cloud project
- Check browser console for specific error messages

### Map shows but no markers
- This is normal - the marker system waits for Google Maps to fully load
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors

## üéØ Current Features
