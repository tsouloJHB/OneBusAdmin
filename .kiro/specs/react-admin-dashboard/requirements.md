# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a comprehensive React-based admin dashboard for managing bus transportation systems. The dashboard will provide administrators with the ability to manage bus routes, buses, and monitor active buses in real-time. The system will integrate with an existing Spring Boot backend via REST APIs and provide a responsive, user-friendly interface for administrative operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to manage bus routes through a web interface, so that I can efficiently add, modify, and remove routes from the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the routes page THEN the system SHALL display a table listing all existing routes
2. WHEN an admin clicks "Add Route" THEN the system SHALL display a form to create a new route
3. WHEN an admin submits a valid route form THEN the system SHALL save the route via POST /api/routes and display success notification
4. WHEN an admin clicks "Edit" on a route THEN the system SHALL display a pre-populated form with route details
5. WHEN an admin submits route updates THEN the system SHALL update the route via PUT /api/routes/{id} and display success notification
6. WHEN an admin clicks "Delete" on a route THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation dialog
7. WHEN an admin confirms route deletion THEN the system SHALL delete the route via DELETE /api/routes/{id} and refresh the list

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to manage buses through a web interface, so that I can maintain the fleet information and ensure proper bus allocation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the buses page THEN the system SHALL display a table listing all buses with their details
2. WHEN an admin clicks "Add Bus" THEN the system SHALL display a form to create a new bus entry
3. WHEN an admin submits a valid bus form THEN the system SHALL save the bus via POST /api/buses and display success notification
4. WHEN an admin clicks "Edit" on a bus THEN the system SHALL display a pre-populated form with bus details
5. WHEN an admin submits bus updates THEN the system SHALL update the bus via PUT /api/buses/{id} and display success notification
6. WHEN an admin clicks "Delete" on a bus THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation dialog
7. WHEN an admin confirms bus deletion THEN the system SHALL delete the bus via DELETE /api/buses/{id} and refresh the list

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to view active buses in real-time, so that I can monitor the current operational status of the fleet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the active buses page THEN the system SHALL display a list of currently active buses
2. WHEN the active buses page loads THEN the system SHALL fetch data via GET /api/active-buses
3. WHEN an admin applies filters THEN the system SHALL display filtered results based on the selected criteria
4. WHEN the active buses data changes THEN the system SHALL update the display to reflect current status
5. IF no active buses are found THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to navigate between different sections of the dashboard, so that I can efficiently access all administrative functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a sidebar navigation with all available sections
2. WHEN an admin clicks on a navigation item THEN the system SHALL navigate to the corresponding page without page refresh
3. WHEN an admin is on a specific page THEN the system SHALL highlight the current section in the navigation
4. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display a summary page with key statistics
5. IF the user navigates to an invalid route THEN the system SHALL display a 404 error page

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the dashboard to be responsive and user-friendly, so that I can use it effectively on different devices and screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard is accessed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout for smaller screens
2. WHEN the dashboard is accessed on tablets THEN the system SHALL provide an optimized tablet experience
3. WHEN forms are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation messages for invalid inputs
4. WHEN API operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators
5. WHEN API operations succeed or fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate notifications
6. WHEN tables contain many items THEN the system SHALL provide pagination or virtual scrolling

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want secure access to the dashboard, so that only authorized personnel can manage the bus system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL redirect to a login page
2. WHEN an admin provides valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate and grant access to the dashboard
3. WHEN an admin session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page
4. WHEN an admin logs out THEN the system SHALL clear the session and redirect to the login page
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want reliable API integration, so that all data operations are consistent with the backend system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL use the configured base URL from environment variables
2. WHEN API calls fail due to network issues THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
3. WHEN API calls return validation errors THEN the system SHALL display field-specific error messages
4. WHEN API calls succeed THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect the changes
5. IF the backend is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a service unavailable message
